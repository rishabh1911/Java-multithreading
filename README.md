# Java Multithreading

This repository contains codes which I made for practicing a Java multithreading course.

These are self-explanatory code examples which are enough for one to understand all the basic concepts for preparation in exams or coding interviews.

#### The Topics include:

  - [How to create Threads in Java.]
  - [Volatile Keyword]
  - [Thread Synchronization]
  - [Locks in Java]
  - [Thread Pool]
  - [Countdown Latch]
  - [Producer - Consumer Problem]
  - [Wait and Notify]
  - [Producer consumer using wait and notify]
  - [Reentrant Lock]
  - [Deadlock]
  - [Semaphore]
  - [Callable and Futures]
  - [Interrupting Threads]
  - [Fork and Join]
